# Self Check
# Test your understanding of what we have covered so far by trying the following exercise.
# Modify the code from Activecode 8 so that the final list only contains a single copy of each letter.
# the answer is: ['c', 'a', 't', 'd', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'b', 'i']

wordlist = ['cat','dog','rabbit']
final = []
for animals in wordlist:
    for letters in animals:
        final.append(letters)
final = set(final)        
print(final)
